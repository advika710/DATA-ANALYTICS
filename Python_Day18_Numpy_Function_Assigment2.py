#Q2. Suppose you have two sets of employee data—one containing information about full-time employees and another containing information about part-time employees. You want to combine this data to create a comprehensive employee dataset for HR analysis. 

import numpy as np

# Employee data for full-time employees
full_time_employees = np.array([
    [101, 'John Doe', 'Full-Time', 55000],
    [102, 'Jane Smith', 'Full-Time', 60000],
    [103, 'Mike Johnson', 'Full-Time', 52000]
])

# Employee data for part-time employees
part_time_employees = np.array([
    [201, 'Alice Brown', 'Part-Time', 25000],
    [202, 'Bob Wilson', 'Part-Time', 28000],
    [203, 'Emily Davis', 'Part-Time', 22000]
])

# Combine full-time and part-time employee data
combined_employees = np.vstack((full_time_employees, part_time_employees))

# Print the combined employee dataset
print("Combined Employee Dataset:")
print(combined_employees)
