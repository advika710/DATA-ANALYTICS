#Q2. Write a function in Python to count and display the total number of words in a text file “ABC.txt”

    # Initialize a counter for the total number of words
    total_words = 0
    
    # Open the file "ABC.txt" in read mode
    with open("ABC.txt", "r") as file:

        for line in file:

            # Add the number of words in the current line to the total count
            total_words += len(words)

    print(f"Total number of words: {total_words}")

# Call the function to count and display the total number of words
count_words_in_file()

#ANS=> Total number of words: 35
