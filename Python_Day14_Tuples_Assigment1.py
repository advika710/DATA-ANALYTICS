#Q1. Write a Python program to find the number of times 4 appears in the tuple. 
#    Input: tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7 )

# Define the tuple with given elements
tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)

# Use the count() method to find the number of times 4 appears in the tuple
count_of_4 = tuplex.count(4)

# Print the result
print("The number 4 appears", count_of_4, "times in the tuple.")

#ANS=> tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)
#ANS=> The number 4 appears 3 times in the tuple.
